Advanced AI Estimation Agent ‚Äì Functional Overview
üß† Intelligent Understanding of Inputs
Document Parsing: AI reads and understands RFQs, blueprints, SOWs, and architectural diagrams using OCR + NLP + CV techniques.

Code & Standard Mapping: Interprets requirements based on NFPA, IBC, and local codes to determine compliance needs (e.g., smoke detector placement per floor).

Auto-Extraction of Components:

Elements Identified: Devices, accessories, wiring, panels, conduits (termed: Estimation Elements)

Metadata Captured: Quantity, specs (voltage, detection type, mounting type), placement location.

ü§ñ AI-Sourced Estimation Elements
AI displays a table of extracted elements from user-submitted files:

Code	Estimation Element	Qty	Spec Summary	Unit Price	Vendor	Action
SD-1001	Smoke Detector	45	Ceiling mount, Photoelectric	$45.99	Graybar	Edit
FS-2002	Fire Panel	2	6-Zone, LCD Display	$399.00	Anixter	Edit

Users can:

Edit specs or manually override selections

View alternative vendors or bulk discounts

Click to see code rationale ("Why this device here?")

üîó Vendor Recommendation Logic
Vendor Matching Agent:

Matches extracted elements with vendors from:

ERP (if connected)

AI-trained vendor catalog (e.g., Honeywell, Graybar, Anixter)

Prioritizes based on: availability, price, delivery time, preferred supplier.

üèóÔ∏è Agent Workflow (Behind the Scenes)
Intake: Parses uploaded files using layout-aware models (e.g., Azure Document Intelligence + custom schema readers).

Matching: Uses vector search or rule-based heuristics to map specs ‚Üí product SKUs.

Vendor Lookup: Calls vendor APIs or scrapes catalog (if no connector).

Pricing & ETA: Pulls real-time pricing, stock, and lead time data.

UI Sync: Feeds structured table back to UI ‚Üí editable table format for users.
